# 4chan-Thread-Archiver
threadSaver.py takes a list of 4chan thread URLs specified in threads.txt (one per line), and archives them into an sqlite database. It also downloads all images in those threads into an 'images' folder in the current directory

With how temporary everythin on 4chan is, this could be pretty handy! Be sure to follow the API rules when running this though
